The instant analysis can be found in the resources section of the manual. 

We will also have your own “Water Guide” reach out to you to go over the results of the instant analysis. This highly trained guide will also provide you with solutions if you find that your water is unsafe. You should get started now by opening up the attached safe water manual and do the instant water analysis right away. It takes less than 60 seconds!.
